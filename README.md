My public Github Pages site

When I was designing this portfolio web, I added some hand-drawn elements that I really like, such as the 
illustration as the banner background. But what I designed as a decorative pattern for the Body Background, which I don't 
know how to implement with Visual Studio Code. Thus can only use the solid color of the background as an alternative.
Besides that, during the process of designing the web page of my portfolio, I realized that the Grid is really 
convenient for responsive setting.
